# What is FPFool?
_FPFool_ is a Google Chrome browser extension which performs camouflage strategies to protect
users against browser fingerprinting. Browser fingerprinting is a web tracking technique
performed by websites to collect personal data from their visitors.

Different from other fingerprinting protection tools, FPFool does not try to detain websites
from generating a fingerprint of their visitors. Instead, FPFool tries to disguise the
interest profile of the user by performing fake actions on websites which were originally
visited by the user.

# How to use FPFool
